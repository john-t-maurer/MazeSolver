# MazeSolver
A simple C++ program that demonstrates proficiency in the language. Uses a Stack data structure to traverse a text maze.\

This project was the most interesting assignment in the whole class for me personally. As soon as I heard that we would be asked to create a maze solving program, I was nervous but excited to tackle the problem. I believe this was the assignment that might've thrown most of my peers off at the time, but I was able to produce a nice solution. I could see how this program could scale, and perhaps at one point it'd be interesting to have the user input a maze text file and give starting and ending coordinates.
